        <h1>The Third Generation</h1>
        <p>While Mazda has made several changes to the new MX-5, the core idea remains of the mx5 stays the same - this car continues to give pure happiness, just as it always has. A charming and compact roadster like this is one of life's enduring pleasures, like a moring coffee on a sunday or taking a long walk along the cliffside paths at sunset."</p>

        <h2>Major changes</h2>
        <div class="page3box1">
            <p> Because the car looks so different from the past two MX-5's the NC didn't really attract many fans, it is by far the most hated generation of all the MX-5's on the market because it really had a "bar of soap" look to it. But apart from the hate it still drives like a Miata and it is actually pretty quick. So what where the changes? First off the previous models where build on an almost identical platform, and the NC shares the platform of an Mazda RX-8, and on top of that, the NC shares no componets with the NB except for the turn signals. you could really say that the NB and NA are brothers, and the NC is more like a cousin from way back. The suspension changed completely because of the different platform, traction control and stability control were added which was great for drivability. The standard engine was a 16-valve 2.0L engine, which resulted in more power, but the weight was also increased to 1.150kg (with hard top) compared to the NB which weighted roughly 1050kg, which results in almost the same power to weight ratio. There are also some truly awesome changes, the six-speed transmission NC included a limited slip differential, which results in awesome drifting!</p>

        <h3> 2008 facelift  </h3>
        <p> Due to the criticism Mazda received from the public the car company decided to make a facelifted model. Which made the car way more visually appealing. The facelift mostly affeted the front bumper, like the larger grille and new head and foglights. Other parts were also changed such as new side skirts, rear bumper and tail lights.</p>
